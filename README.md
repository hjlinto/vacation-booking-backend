# 🏝️ Vacation Booking Back-End System

A Java Spring Boot RESTful back-end developed for a vacation booking platform. This application serves as the server-side component of a fictional travel agency's booking system and integrates with a pre-built Angular front-end and a MySQL database.

The project modernizes legacy back-end functionality by implementing a modular, scalable, and database-driven solution using the Spring framework.

## Features

- RESTful API for customer vacation bookings
- Entity modeling for customers, vacations, excursions, carts, and locations
- Checkout system with POST endpoint for placing orders
- Custom service layer with response tracking
- Input validation for front-end form compatibility
- CORS configuration for Angular integration
- Sample data preloaded at runtime

---

## Developer Contributions

This project was based on a starter structure and expanded to include:

- Entity classes and enums designed from UML and ERD specifications
- Repositories with Spring Data JPA and CORS support
- Service layer implementing checkout logic and response DTOs
- REST controller for placing customer orders
- Input validation logic for required fields
- Seed data for five sample customers on application start
- Full integration testing using an unmodified Angular front-end

All development followed Git version control practices.
